**<h1 align="center"> Gluten Free Recipe App</h1>**

### This app allows the user to look through a variety of gluten free recipes. In addition, the user can add new recipes, edit existing recipes, and delete recipes that are no longer needed.

### There is an integreated rich text editor, called Tinymce, that is uesed for creating, editing, and showing recipes. This provides a much easier user interface for creating/editing recipes.

### **Background:**

A year ago my daughter was diagnosed with celiac disease. **[Celiac disease](https://celiac.org/)** is an immune reaction to gluten (a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye) that damages the small intestine. Since she's already a picky eater, it has made it quite challenging to prepare meals. I created this app to help organize recipes that she may like or that we know she likes.

### **Future Enhancements**

- Looking to see if it's possible to create an interactive map, of the rover waypoints/sols, and let the user click the waypoint to get the weather at that location. Due to Same Origin Policy, I cannot directly interact with the iframe, of the NASA map, to get the sol based on location.

- Look at carousel slide image heights to reduce "jumping" when clicking the carousel buttons.
